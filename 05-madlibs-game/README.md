### 📚 What You'll Learn

Create a fun word game that combines user input and string formatting to generate silly stories!

### 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Use `f-strings` to create dynamic text
- Understand how to structure an interactive program
- Have fun with `creative programming!`

### 📖 Concept Explanation

#### What is Madlibs?

Madlibs is a phrasal template word game where:

1. Players are asked to provide words (noun, verb, adjective, etc.)
2. They DON'T know the story context
3. Their words are inserted into a pre-written story
4. The result is usually funny and unexpected!

#### Parts of Speech Reminder

- **Noun**: Person, place, or thing (cat, pizza, teacher, ocean)
- **Verb**: Action word (run, jump, sing, dance)
- **Adjective**: Describes a noun (big, red, funny, delicious)
- **Adverb**: Describes a verb (quickly, slowly, happily)
- **-ing Verb**: Present continuous (running, jumping, singing)

#### How the Program Works

```python
1. Ask user for words (without showing the story)
2. Store each word in a variable
3. Insert variables into story template using f-strings
4. Display the completed story
```

### 💡 Example Run

#### User Input:

```bash

Enter a noun: elephant  # an object
Enter another adjective: purple
Enter a verb ending with 'ing': dancing # Present continuous -verb

```

#### Output Story:

```

I was confused!
```

- A place
- A food item

#### Exercise 2: Create Your Own Madlib

Write a completely `new story template` about:

- Going to school
- A superhero adventure
- A cooking disaster
- A space journey

#### Exercise 3: Themed Madlibs

Create madlibs for specific themes:

- **Horror Story**: scary adjectives, spooky nouns
- **Romance**: romantic verbs, lovely adjectives
- **Comedy**: funny situations

---

#### 💻 Code Template for Your Own Madlib

```python
# Get user input
noun1 = input("Enter a noun: ")
verb1 = input("Enter a verb: ")
adjective1 = input("Enter an adjective: ")
place = input("Enter a place: ")

# Create your story
print(f"\nOnce upon a time, in a {adjective1} {place},") # use f-string
print(f"there was a {noun1} who loved to {verb1}.")
print("The end!")
```

---

### 🎨 Story Templates to Try

#### Template 1: Adventure Story

```python
character = input("Character name: ")
adjective = input("Adjective: ")
place = input("Place: ")
verb = input("Verb (past tense): ")

print(f"{character} went to the {adjective} {place}.")
print(f"There, {character} {verb} and found treasure!")
```

#### Template 2: News Report

```python
city = input("City name: ")
noun = input("Noun: ")
number = input("Number: ")
adjective = input("Adjective: ")

print(f"BREAKING NEWS from {city}!")
print(f"A {adjective} {noun} was spotted {number} times today!")
```

### 🔍 Tips for Great Madlibs

#### 1. Be Specific in Prompts

```python
# Vague:
word = input("Enter a word: ")  # User doesn't know what kind

# Better:
animal = input("Enter an animal: ")  # Clear instruction
```

#### 2. Use Descriptive Variable Names

```python
# Confusing:
x = input("Enter something: ")

# Clear:
favorite_food = input("Enter your favorite food: ")
```

#### 3. Add Context to Output

```python
print("\n===== YOUR MADLIB STORY =====\n")
# ... story here ...

print("\n==============================")
```

### 🎮 Challenge Projects

#### Challenge 1: Multiple Endings

Create a madlib with 2-3 different endings that randomly select.

#### Challenge 2: Repeated Words

Ask for one word and use it multiple times in the story in different contexts.

#### Challenge 3: Long Story

Create a madlib that uses at least 10 different words and tells a complete story with beginning, middle, and end.

### 🚀 Try It Yourself

1. Run the existing madlib and try it with different words
2. Modify the story template to make it funnier
3. Create a brand new madlib about your favorite topic
4. Share your madlib with friends and see what funny stories they create!

### 📝 Key Learning Points

- User input can be stored in many variables
- `F-strings` make it easy to insert variables into text
- The order of `input()` statements determines the user experience
- Creative prompts lead to funnier results
- Programs can be `fun and educational` at the same time!
